# applog

Application and Audit Log package for Laravel 5.

## Debug and Logging

This package extends the existing Laravel 5 log writer with the following features:

* Add a log listener so that application (debug, info, error) logs get written to an applogs
  database table as well as to the on-disk log files.
* Extend the application logs to include information such as the class name, function name,
  file name and line number where the log entry is recorded.
* Add the facility to audit log database models, so that database changes get recorded as
  audit logs to the applogs table.
* Turn off all debug logging when the app.debug config variable is set to false.

This package contains the following classes and traits:

* Applog -- model class allowing logs to be written to the database.
* Auditable -- a trait that can be applied to any model class allowing any changes to the
  table to be automatically audited.

## Installation

Add these lines to your composer.json file:

```
    "require": {
        "delatbabel/applog": "~1.0"
    },
```

Once that is done, run the composer update command:

```
    composer update
```

### Register Service Provider

After composer update completes, add this line to your config/app.php file in the 'providers' array:

```
Delatbabel\Applog\DebugServiceProvider::class,
```

### Boostrap the Log Writer

Modify each of app/Console/Kernel.php and app/Http/Kernel.php to include the following bootstrappers function:

```php
protected function bootstrappers()
{
    $bootstrappers = parent::bootstrappers();

    // Swap out the default Laravel ConfigureLogging class with our own.
    foreach ($bootstrappers as $key => $value) {
        if ($value == 'Illuminate\Foundation\Bootstrap\ConfigureLogging') {
            $bootstrappers[$key] = 'Delatbabel\Applog\Bootstrap\ConfigureLogging';
        }
    }

    return $bootstrappers;
}
```

Note that Delatbabel\Applog\Bootstrap\ConfigureLogging replaces the original class
Illuminate\Foundation\Bootstrap\ConfigureLogging.   You may of course
already have a bootstrappers function in your Kernel.php files with other
bootstrappers replaced, in which case you just need to modify it to include
the updated ConfigureLogging bootstrapper code.

### Incorporate and Run the Migrations

Finally, incorporate and run the migration scripts to create the database tables as follows:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=migrations --force
php artisan migrate
```

## Example

### Audit Logging

In order to turn audit logging on for a model class, use this code:

```php
use Delatbabel\Applog\Models\Auditable;

class MyModel
{
    use Auditable;
    // ... remainder of the model code
}
```

This will now log changes to the model into the applogs table.  Note that there is an
Applog model class which you can use (Delatbabel\Applog\Models\Applog) to manipulate this
table, please ensure that you don't use the Auditable trait in that model class or you
will cause an infinite loop and fill the database.

### Debug and Error Logging

To use debug logging in your code, use this code:

```php
Log::debug(__CLASS__.':'.__TRAIT__.':'.__FILE__.':'.__LINE__.':'.__FUNCTION__.':'.
    'POST login');
```

Note that the message on the second line can be anything you want it to be â€“ be descriptive.
The first line should appear exactly as written above.

You can substitute the debug function name with any of the log levels from RFC 5254 which
are debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, and alert.  All of these will be written
to the applogs table as well as to the disk files.  debug level messages will not be written
when the debug config variable contained in config/app.php is set to false.

You can provide a context array as the second parameter to the Log::debug statement as follows:

```php
Log::debug(__CLASS__.':'.__TRAIT__.':'.__FILE__.':'.__LINE__.':'.__FUNCTION__.':'.
    'POST login', ['attributes' => $attributes ]);
```

The entire array will be JSON encoded and stored in the details field of the applogs table.
You can use this to capture any arbitrary set of variables at the time of logging.

## Helper Function -- get_user_name()

The audit log attempts to capture the user name of each user that was logged in when a change
is made.  To aid in this, provide a global function called get_user_name(), returning a string
(user name, email address or other identifier).

An example of such a function using the Cartalyst Sentinel facade is as follows:

```php
use Cartalyst\Sentinel\Laravel\Facades\Sentinel;

function get_user_name()
{
    // Fetch the currently logged in user
    try {
        $user       = Sentinel::getUser();
        $username   = $user ? $user->email: '';
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        // Ignore
    }
    return $username;
}
```

If the function does not exist or returns a null / empty value, some fallback values will be
used, culminating in "system" if no username can be found.
