/**
 * Debug Service Provider
 *
 * Functionality:
 *
 * * Add a log listener so that application (debug, info, error) logs
 *   get written to an applogs database table as well as to the on-disk
 *   log files.
 * * Extend the application logs to include information such as the class
 *   name, function name, file name and line number where the log entry
 *   is recorded.
 * * Add the facility to audit log database models, so that database
 *   changes get recorded as audit logs to the applogs table.
 * * Turn off all debug logging when the app.debug config variable is
 *   set to false.
 *
 * To use debug logging in your code, use this code:
 *
 * <code>
 *   Log::debug(__CLASS__.':'.__TRAIT__.':'.__FILE__.':'.__LINE__.':'.__FUNCTION__.':'.
 *      'POST login');
 * </code>
 *
 * Note that the message on the second line can be anything you want
 * it to be â€“ be descriptive.  The first line should appear exactly
 * as written above.
 *
 * You can substitute the debug function name with any of the log
 * levels from RFC 5254 which are debug, info, notice, warning, error,
 * critical, and alert.  All of these will be written to the applogs
 * table as well as to the disk files.  debug level messages will
 * not be written when the debug config variable contained in
 * config/app.php is set to false.
 *
 * You can provide a context array as the second parameter to the
 * Log::debug statement as follows:
 *
 * <code>
 *   Log::debug(__CLASS__.':'.__TRAIT__.':'.__FILE__.':'.__LINE__.':'.__FUNCTION__.':'.
 *      'POST login', ['attributes' => $attributes]);
 * </code>
 *
 * The entire array will be JSON encoded and stored in the details
 * field of the applogs table.  You can use this to capture any arbitrary
 * set of variables at the time of logging.
